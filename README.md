#### Abstract: 
The expense of buying or renting the property to live could be one of the largest portions throughout peopleâ€™s lives. Research has shown that the millennials are spending $93,000 on rent by age 30 [1]. Renting the right apartment at the right time can profoundly benefit the renter. In this project, our goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the price of rental apartments. Our features include the data about the apartment rooms, such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, as well as the apartment building itself, such as the amenities. After a series of modeling and experimentation, we discovered that the random forest regressor has the best performance and can explain the most amount of variance when predicting the rental price.
